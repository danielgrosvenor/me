At around 2:00 PM in White Island in the Bay of Plenty off the coast of the North Island, there was a volcanic eruption that was more powerful than any of the eruptions in the past 60 years. There were an unknown number of injuries. I was 150 miles away from the eruption when it happened and so I was unaffected. I think if it wasn't a cloudy day then I would have been able to see the volcanic ash cloud from the top of Mount Victoria. It is just blending in with the other clouds. 

Tomorrow I will read news reports and other information about the volcano and write a longer post about it.
