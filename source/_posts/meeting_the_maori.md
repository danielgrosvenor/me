I went to Rotorua and it had a lot of geothermal activity so it smelled like sulfur. I went to a naturally fed hot tub and pool. At the end of my visit I went to a Maori cultural experience.

The Maori people arrived in New Zealand in around 1320. They came in a Polynesian style voyager canoe.

The welcoming ceremony is called Whakatau and is a series of dances. This is how they welcome visitors.

There is a dance called the Poi and it is performed by the woman of the tribe and it is swinging the balls on strings. The Haka is the war dance of the Maori people and it is to show the strength of the warriors.

The meal was good and my favorite part was the lamb. There was sea food and meat of many kinds as well as many vegetables. They were cooked with the style called Hangi which is a hole in the ground with hot rocks that is covered by vegetation.

The Maori keep their identity as well as functioning in every day life. How they do this is they use the geothermal phenomenon in their land and they show the tourists the activity in Rotourua and it holds a lot of culture so they teach the kids their culture and their language.
